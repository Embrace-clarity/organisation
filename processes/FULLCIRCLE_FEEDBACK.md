# Full-Circle Feedback
## Intro

The Full-circle feedback process allows all team members to change Feeld for the better. It's about collecting feedback and advice from everyone within the organisation.

> Remember, the Full-circle feedback process is what gives you the authority to do something. If you donâ€™t follow it, you have no authority to take that action.

## Things to be careful with

*Retrospective Full-circle feedback proposals are not permitted*
There is a strong presumption that an Full-circle feedback needs to be agreed before you take action. If it's possible for us for people to 'do first and ask permission later', we remove the important 'peer review' part of the Full-circle feedback process where your teammates give feedback on an action. So when thinking about these Proposals, keep in mind that if the Full-circle feedback is for something you've done already, such as an item you've purchased or a retrospective salary increase you might like to make, it can be unlikely to be accepted by the team.

*Proposals aren't requests*
Proposals are designed to gather feedback on your idea to improve something at Feeld and help you make an informed decision. They aren't a tool for requesting things from other or the organisation. At the end you decide if you should go forward with your proposal.

*Discussion and implementation in private is forbidden*
It's against Feeld's transparency policy to discuss and implement ideas that will impact the whole company. Such proposals can only happen publicly by acquiring feedback from all parts of the organisation.

*Sharing privately for proofreading or general feedback is fine*
Sometimes we need an extra eye and that's fine as long as it's not a secretive proposal.

## Follow the guide

### 1. Write the proposal

In this, you should outline the following things. The more significant your action is, the more thorough the proposal must be. Use your judgement.

 1. Follow the Template in
 2. Place it in the according folder in Proposals

### 2. Share the proposal with everyone

Proposal will be automatically rejected if sent only to one person for "approval".

The more significant your decision (higher costs, or potential effects), the greater your obligation is to make sure people are aware of it and have a chance to give their opinion:If it's a very quick and simple item that you just want to make people aware of, a Quip doc can be sufficient. Where possible, try to avoid creating proposals in Slack because it doesn't create much of a 'paper trail'.
